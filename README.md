# Automated-Notes-Taker

NLP-based Application that aims to convert online class recordings into simple and concise summaries by using Extractive Text Summarization. Summarization is done using Sentence Feature Scoring and subsequent Defuzzification.

Execute repRE first, to load the user defined package created to expand contractions. Execute Automated Note Taker Final.py for project.
To check experimental results, execute analysis.py, by changing values of reference and candidate according to the data set of choice. Articles 1-5 have been added along with their summaries that were computed using experiment.py 
Voice Recordings used as input for Speech to Text have been included as .wav files. 
(NOTE: There may be some difference in final speech to text result based on python version and speech recognizer on system)
