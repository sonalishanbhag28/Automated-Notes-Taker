# Automated-Notes-Taker

NLP-based Application that aims to convert online class recordings into simple and concise summaries by using Hybrid Text Summarization- a combination of abstractive and extractive methodologies. Summarization is done using Sentence Feature Scoring and subsequent Defuzzification.

Execute ``python repRE.py`` first, to load the user defined package created to expand contractions.

Execute ``flask run`` to run the web application.

Voice Recordings used as input for Speech to Text have been included as .wav files.
(NOTE: There may be some difference in final speech to text result based on python version and speech recognizer on system)
